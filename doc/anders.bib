abstract = {Cubical type theory provides a constructive justification to certain aspects of homotopy
type theory such as Voevodsky's univalence axiom. This makes many extensionality principles,
like function and propositional extensionality, directly provable in the theory. This
paper describes a constructive semantics, expressed in a presheaf topos with suitable
structure inspired by cubical sets, of some higher inductive types. It also extends
cubical type theory by a syntax for the higher inductive types of spheres, torus,
suspensions, truncations, and pushouts. All of these types are justified by the semantics
and have judgmental computation rules for all constructors, including the higher dimensional
ones, and the universes are closed under these type formers.},
